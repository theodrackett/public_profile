<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Theo Drackett. Born in Jamaica, lived in Canada for a number of years and now living in California with my 
  family.
</p>

<p>I am a software engineer who mostly does software testing. I have worked at several large companies and would love 
  to one day work at a startup. 
</p>

<p>I really love to learn! New technology absolutely intriigue me. I find myself going through a lot of courses on Udemy. 
  Some just for the knowledge and not necessarily career improvement.
  My favourite languages are Pyton and JavaScript.
</p>

<p>I will continue to learn forever becasue, for me, that is the essence of life.</p>
